 *  CC identifies the connected components in an undirected
 *  graph. A graph may have multiple connected components which are not
 *  connected to each other. These are identified by running DFS and keeping a
 *  list of marked vertices.
 *  
 *  Following API is supported by CC:
 *  --------------------------------------
 *       CC(Graph G)  		// process the graph G to identify CC.
 *   int count()			// number of connected components
 *   int id(int v)			// returns the connected component id (0 to count()-1) in which the given vertex v lies
 *
