 *  ----------------------------------------------
 *  Graph is an abstract Data type that represents the collection
 *  of vertices and edges as provided by input.
 *
 *  The Graph will be studied and developed in four flavors:
 *  1. Undriected Graph
 *  2. Directed Graph
 *  3. Weighted Undirected Graph
 *  4. Weighted Digraph
 *
 *  The Graph is implemented using adjacency list, which allows self loops
 *  and parallel edges as well. Every edge will be stored twice in this
 *  representation. However this representation is the most efficient among
 *  others like Adjacency matrix, array of edges etc.
 *
 *  Various operations that are performed on graph like search, finding path,
 *  minimum path and other queries will be developed as their own class which
 *  utilize Graph G as input.

/**
 * Graph is an ADT that represents a collection of vertices V and the connection amongst them
 * called edges E. Every Graph G is defined as function of G = f(V, E). A graph is created by
 * calling one of the two constuctors. One creates a graph with given number of vertices.
 * Other takes a stream input and initializes the graph from stream data.
 *
 * Graph provides following API
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Graph (int v)                   // constructs a graph with given no. of vertices
 * Graph (Stream s)                // constructs a graph from input stream data
 * int V()                         // returns the number of vertices
 * int E()                         // returns the number of edges
 * Iterable<Integer> adj(int v)    // returns the adjacent vertices list of a given vertex v.
 * void addEdge(int v, int w)      // adds an edge between vertex v and w.
