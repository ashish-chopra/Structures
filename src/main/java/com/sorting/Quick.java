 * -----------------------------------------------
 * Sorting is the process of rearranging a sequence of objects so as to put them 
 * in some logical order. The Quick sort algorithm is using divide and conquer algorithm. 
 * Quick sort first divides a large list into two smaller sub-lists: the low elements and 
 * the high elements. Quick sort can then recursively sort the sub-lists. 
 *  *  Features:
 *  
 *  1. Quick Sort is implemented as an array of Comparable Objects and sorts them
 *     based on their natural order defined by Comparable interface.
 *  2. In case if client wants to sort the objects in some other order than the natural
 *     order of objects, then client can call the overloaded method 
 *     Quick.sort(array, comparator) and pass the comparator object which gives the 
 *     customized ordering   
 *  3. It is a generic implementation which can take any type of array of objects.   
 *  4. The implementation is based on array based data structure.
 *  5. The running time complexity of each operation in average case is constant, O(N log N), 
 *     but in worst case it is O(N2).
 *
