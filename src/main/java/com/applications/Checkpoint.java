 * ----------------------------------------------------
 *  Checkpoint data structure is used to store actions of an application.
 *  It also provides functionality to undo an action or redo an action.
 *  
 *  This data structure only abstracts the said functionality, without getting
 *  into the details of performing actions. Hence for simplicity, i took
 *  the action to be an integer code that will be stored in the data structure.

 *  		Checkpoint()			// creates a new checkpoint data structure
 *  boolean		add(Item actionCode)	// adds the action code
 *  Item	undo()					// undo the last performed action.
 *  Item	redo()					// redo the last performed undo action.
 *  int		size()					// return the size of all actions stored as of yet.
 *  boolean	isEmpty()				// returns is the checkpoint list is empty.
