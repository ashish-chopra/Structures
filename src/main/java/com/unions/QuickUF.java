 *  QuickUF is an adaptation of union-find data structure in which
 *  union operation is optimized to carry out in constant time. It 
 *  however affects the time taken by find() operation. 
 *  
 *  In quick-union technique, each object is marked by its parent.
 *  and during union operation, the root of p becomes the child of root
 *  of q. And two objects are said to be connected if their roots are same.
